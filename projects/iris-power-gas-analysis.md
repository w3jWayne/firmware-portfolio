# IRIS POWER (A Qualitrol Company) – Gas Analysis Monitoring Systems

## Context
Industrial / medical-grade monitoring system requiring high reliability, deterministic behavior, and long-term maintainability.

## My Role
Firmware Developer (system-level ownership across architecture, implementation, and validation support).

## What I Worked On (NDA-safe, high-level)
- Migrated a legacy **RTOS-based** embedded platform to **Yocto Linux** to improve scalability and maintainability.
- Re-architected components for **IPC-based inter-process data sharing**, improving modularity.
- Implemented **SQLite-based onboard data logging** to improve data integrity and reliability.
- Supported integration and validation with cross-functional hardware/system teams.

## Key Focus Areas
- Reliability & data integrity
- System architecture modernization
- Debugging and validation support
